    "> #### 4. If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too high“\n",
    "> #### 5. Else If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”\n",
    "> #### 6. And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.\n",
    "> #### 7. Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.\n"
